This project is an implementation of the classic arcade game Breakout, developed using JavaFX. The game showcases the capabilities of JavaFX for building interactive and visually appealing GUI applications. Players control a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball and break a series of bricks arranged at the top. The objective is to clear all the bricks without letting the ball fall off the bottom of the screen.
